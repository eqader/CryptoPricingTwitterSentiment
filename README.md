# CryptoPricingTwitterSentiment

This was a Georgia Tech project worked on by my team and I using the enterprise edition for Georgia Tech ported over to my personal for display.

This project runs on AWS S3 storing crypto prices and sentiment predictions. AWS S3 is turned off for cost saving but the data files are uploaded to demonstrate the tool.
