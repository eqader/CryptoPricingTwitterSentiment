# SETUP
This project was written using Python 3.7
Third party libraries are listed in requirements.txt. You can install these with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
You will need to rename the config_template.py file to config.py. Then, add your AWS and Twitter API keys to this file. DO NOT PUSH secrets into the repo (this should be in your gitignore).
